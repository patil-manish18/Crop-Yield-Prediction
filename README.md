Hosted Project : https://predicting-cropyield.streamlit.app/

Objectives
1) To analyze remote sensing data to improve yield prediction accuracy and capture critical environmental and crop health factors like NDVI & EVI.
2) To develop a highly accurate machine learning model that predicts crop yield by leveraging both spatial and temporal features extracted from satellite data.
3) To study groundnut crop yield across five districts of Gujarat using real-time data from MODIS satellite.
